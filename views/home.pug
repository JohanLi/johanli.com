                Hi, I'm Johan Li. I work at #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_Interactive") Paradox Interactive] as a web developer,
                building our e-commerce platform and online services.

                What fascinates me is how complex and fast-moving of a world we live in, not least in the tech industry.
                It's interesting to reflect over how tech has changed society, as well as predict what will happen in the future.
